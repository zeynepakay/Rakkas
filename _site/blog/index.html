<p>After suspending my studies at University of Reading, I inadvertently took a hiatus from type design. I closed myself off from experiencing and engaging with all forms of visual culture. I felt inadequate to interact with my once-peers on subjects which, before, would have been within my purview. I thought my current environment was bridling my creativity, which was, at times a valid excuse to not pursuing what I had once wanted.</p>
