<p class="message">
THIS IS THE RUQ’AH PROJECT. THIS SITE WILL CHRONICLE THE RESEARCH BEHIND AND THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A SINGLE-WEIGHT, DISPLAY-ORIENTED, RUQ’AH-INSPIRED TYPEFACE WITH ARABIC AND LATIN COMPONENTS. WHEN COMPLETE, THE TYPEFACE WILL BE ADDED TO THE GOOGLE WEBFONTS LIBRARY.
</p>

The written content of The Ruq’ah Project will be categorized as either research articles or design and development updates, all of which will be open to comments and discussion. The language will hopefully be accessible not just to professional type-designers but also to beginners, students and enthusiasts. After the project births its practical output, it will hopefully remain a self-contained, relevant resource for style-specific Arabic type design and development.
